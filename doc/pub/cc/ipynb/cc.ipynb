    "## More on memory\n",
    "\n",
    "  One limitation that will be ran into while trying to do realistic\n",
    "  CCD calculations is that of memory. The four-indexed two-body matrix elements (TBMEs) and\n",
    "  $t$-amplitudes have to store a lot of elements, and the size of these\n",
    "  arrays can quickly exceed the available memory on\n",
    "  a machine. If a calculation wants to use 500 single-particle basis states, then\n",
    "  a structure like $\\langle pq\\vert v\\vert rs\\rangle $ will need a  length of 500 for each of\n",
    "  its four indices, which means it will have $500^4 = 625\\times 10^8$\n",
    "  elements. To get a handle on how much memory is used, consider the\n",
    "  elements as double-precision floating point type. One double takes\n",
    "  up 8 bytes of memory. This specific array would take up $8\\times 625\\times 10^8$ bytes\n",
    "  = $5000 \\times 10^8$ bytes = $500$ Gbytes of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using symmetries\n",
    "\n",
    "Most personal\n",
    "  computers in 2016 have 4-8 Gbytes of RAM, meaning that this calculation would\n",
    "  be way out of reach. There are supercomputers that can handle\n",
    "  applications using 500 Gbytes of memory, but we can quickly reduce\n",
    "  the total memory required by applying some physical arguments. In\n",
    "  addition to vanishing elements with repeated indices, mentioned\n",
    "  above, elements that do not obey certain symmetries are also\n",
    "  zero. Almost all realistic two-body forces preserve some quantities\n",
    "  due to symmetries in the interaction. For example, an interaction\n",
    "  with rotational symmetry will conserve angular momentum. This means\n",
    "  that a two-body ket state $\\vert rs\\rangle $, which has some set of quantum\n",
    "  numbers, will retain quantum numbers corresponding to the\n",
    "  interaction symmetries after being acted on by $\\hat{v}$. This state\n",
    "  is then projected onto $\\vert pq\\rangle $ with its own set of quantum\n",
    "  numbers. Thus $\\langle pq|v|rs\\rangle $ is only non-zero if $\\vert pq\\rangle$ and\n",
    "  $\\vert rs\\rangle $ share the same quantum numbers that are preserved by\n",
    "  $\\hat{v}$. In addition, because the cluster operators represent\n",
    "  excitations due to the interaction, $t_{ij}^{ab}$ is only non-zero\n",
    "  if $\\vert ij\\rangle $ has the same relevant quantum numbers as $\\vert ab\\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using symmetries II\n",
    "\n",
    "  To take advantage of this, these two-body ket states can be\n",
    "  organized into \"channels\" of shared quantum numbers. In the case\n",
    "  of the pairing model, the interaction preserves the total spin\n",
    "  projection of a two-body state, $S_{z}=s_{z1}+s_{z2}$. The single\n",
    "  particle states can have spin of +1/2 or -1/2, so there can be three\n",
    "  two-body channels with $S_{z}=-1,0,+1$. These channels can then be\n",
    "  indexed with a unique label in a similar way to the single particle\n",
    "  index scheme. In more complicated systems, there will be many more\n",
    "  channels involving multiple symmetries, so it is useful to create a\n",
    "  data structure that stores the relevant two-body quantum numbers to\n",
    "  keep track of the labeling scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using symmetries III\n",
    "\n",
    "  It is more efficient to use two-dimensional array data\n",
    "  structures, where the first index refers to the channel number and\n",
    "  the second refers to the element within that channel. So to access\n",
    "  matrix elements or $t$ amplitudes, you can loop over the channels\n",
    "  first, then the indices within that channel. To get an idea of the\n",
    "  savings using this block diagonal structure, let's look at a case\n",
    "  with a plane wave basis, with three momentum and one spin quantum\n",
    "  numbers, with an interaction that conserves linear momentum in all\n",
    "  three dimensions, as well as the total spin projection. Using 502\n",
    "  basis states, the TBME's require about 0.23 Gb of memory in block\n",
    "  diagonal form, which is an enormous saving from the 500 Gb mentioned\n",
    "  earlier in the na\\\"ive storage scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using intermediates\n",
    "\n",
    "  Since the calculation of all  zeros can now be avoided,\n",
    "  improvements in speed and memory will now follow. To get a handle on\n",
    "  how these CCD calculations are implemented we need only to look at the\n",
    "  most expensive sum in equation ([eq:ccd2](#eq:ccd2)). This corresponds to\n",
    "  the sum over $klcd$. Since this sum is repeated for all $i < j$ and\n",
    "  $a < b$, it means that these equations will scale as\n",
    "  $\\mathcal{O}(n_{p}^{4} n_{h}^{4})$. However,\n",
    "  they can be rewritten using intermediates as"
